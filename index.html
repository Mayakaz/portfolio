            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>I’m Maya Kazmierski,</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            <p>I am a student at the University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire. I am currently working towards my bachelor's degree in Interpersonal Strategic Communication emphasis of public       relations with a minor in business communications. 
            <br>Over the last couple of years, I worked in the childcare industry and have worked as a mentor for an interpersonal communications course. At these jobs, I was able to balance multiple tasks, work effectively with others, create events, and bring strong organizational skills to the work environment. I have achieved placement on the Dean’s List for the past four semesters.<br>
            In my free time I enjoy travelling, spending time with my family and cooking. I hope this website allows you to take a look at some of the work I have completed so far in my college education!</p>
